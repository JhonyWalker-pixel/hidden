## :clipboard: About the project

I had an idea for animation for a website and decided to see how it would look, and this is the result of an animation to hide a word from the main text. It is simple, but pleasant to see. If you want to see the project running, click [here](https://jhonywalker-pixel.github.io/hidden/)

## :computer: Languages used

The best part is that it was just using HTML and CSS.
